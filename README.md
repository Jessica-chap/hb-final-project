Practical fitness tracker:

* users can create an individual account
* track their bodyweight
* create workouts with customizable measurements/inputs
* save these workouts to use in the future

## Creator

This project is the culmination of what I learned during
the first 10 weeks of my Hackbright, Perficient sponsored, 
full stack engineering boot camp. 

Prior to entering the technology field, the past 20 years of my career has been customer service centered, and I hope to use that experience in understanding customer needs and building products to reflect that expertise.

In the future I plan to expand the app as I learn new 
technologies and gain more experience in the field.
