## Project Proposal

### Overview

Create a user-based fitness web-app, where user can create profile, from their profile page choose preloaded workouts or create their own. Plus if they want to take the workout outside, utilize google maps to find local park near them. 

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- List any APIs or data sources you're planning on using here
    For the workout/exercise information 
    https://wger.de/en/software/api

    For park location 
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview

### Data

- List data you'll want to store in your database
        --Link in Frodo for data model--

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- User profile page from premade stored users, age, weight
- Workouts page, with premade workout lists that user can pick from 
- When workout selected show list of exercises sets/reps


#### 2.0

- Map page to search location for local parks in area
- More information about exercise selctions, image of muscles used
- User can create their own workout from list of exercises/sets/reps
    and comment on their workout
- Save workouts to days of week to set schedule for the week

#### 3.0

- 'Maybe 2.0' - Create unique user login
- User can store and recall past saved workouts
- Share location of park with other users, or non-users
- Larger library of premade workouts/ no equipment workouts

### Notes

For the 'far' future, want to work on building with my own data for the workouts
